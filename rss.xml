            <title><![CDATA[Graphical interface: a shaped emotion, a message in a well-defined system]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="text__p">Let me introduce myself. I am an <em>Interface Designer</em> at Yandex, and I&#39;ve been involved with projects like Yandex.Maps
and Search Engine Results Page, and also designed brand icons, promo materials, documentation, a project planner, a
shared interface component library, and a fast prototyping system. Besides that, I follow my colleagues&#39; projects such
as Yandex Main Page and other Yandex portal services: Market, News, Images, Video, Disk, Auto, Realty. I see how these
projects grow and evolve.</p><!-- cut -->

<p class="text__p">After some time, I drew certain conclusions from this process, and decided to share those of them which were proven by
stats and numbers. This is an overview, focused on these questions:</p><ul>
<li>Should an interface designer be able to draw and work with fonts?</li>
<li>Should designers work on texts themselves?</li>
<li>Is it necessary to code and do HTML/CSS?</li>
<li>How interfaces should be evaluated?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text__p">Before we dive in, here is a couple of common term definitions:</p><p class="text__p"><em>Interface</em> is a model of interaction with a product.</p><p class="text__p"><em>Designer</em> is a person who defines interface type and content.</p><p class="text__p">Examples of interface types:</p><ul>
<li>graphical</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>command line</li>
<li>voice interface</li>
</ul>
<p class="text__p">The graphical interface is what we are discussing.</p><p class="text__p">I&#39;d like to emphasize that &quot;interface&quot; does not equal &quot;buttons&quot;, and &quot;designer&quot; is not an antipode of &quot;developer&quot;.</p><p class="text__p">An extra note: I can&#39;t say I read lots of books on the subject, I don&#39;t have a degree in arts; nonetheless, design is
how I earn money since my university years. Therefore my experience comes mostly from practice and observing the world
around me.</p><h2 class="text-header text-header_lvl_2" id="shape"><a href="#shape" class="text-header__anchor">Shape</a></h2><p class="text__p">When I was a kid, I saw drawing as a process of projecting images out of my head onto a piece of paper. Later on, when
I started copying images from comic books or drawing things I saw around, the process of drawing became a practical
skill of observing and correctly measuring various object details.</p><p class="text__p">It didn&#39;t take me much time to understand the true value of form, but it wasn&#39;t until much later that I started paying
more attention to color. Still being a schoolboy, I drew cartoons in Flash together with a friend, who criticized me for
using a primitive color palette, such as <code>#F00</code> for red or <code>#0F0</code> for blue. I can&#39;t imagine myself doing that now, but
at that time I was quite content with those acid colors — in fact, a mere color abbreviation: &quot;this is blue&quot;,
&quot;this is red&quot;. I prefer to blame the default (ordinary) Flash editor palette, as it didn&#39;t inspire one to look for new
and uncommon color combinations.</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*kunb6fFJzaxdPCvDdL4nCQ.jpeg"/></p><p class="text__p">A couple of drawing lessons would have done me good. I could have learned about the color wheel and HSV-model.
Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have time for that, so I learned about colors in my physics class at school while studying
stuff like light wave spectrum. A special thanks goes to my friend, too.</p><p class="text__p">An <a href="http://whoyougle.ru/services/color">interface example</a> from my first job:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*SG-gWiaq9rK51ToEPQN6fQ.png"/></p><div class='article__tip'> 
The selected color is named <b>Dove-coloured</b>, and aside you can see a list of resembling colors with their names.
</div>

<p class="text__p">For some time I was even considering a career in illustration. For that purpose, I downloaded all the issues of the
2D-Artist Magazine, and went through drawing tutorials step-by-step: fantasy, anime, animals with thick fur, snow on
the tree branches, and many others. This isn&#39;t too hard when you get to drawing your 10th wolf or 20th tree. Drawing
something out of your head is much more difficult — one needs practice, a lot of it.</p><p class="text__p">Experimenting with Photoshop brushes:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*DYns-3bPVCjSVGgDHtLTnA.png"/></p><p class="text__p">Finding my own style:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*wJyCyAH3u-NWB7bZ40j08Q.png"/></p><p class="text__p">However, I didn&#39;t earn my first money by drawing stuff. I got paid for designing a web interface for a popular science
portal, Whoyougle — quite a quirk of fate, wasn&#39;t it? That helped me shift my focus towards what I still do these days.</p><p class="text__p"><a href="http://whoyougle.ru/services/dogs">The above-mentioned interface</a>: visual dog breed selector</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*8d_S6hCvvCmwiRLJg0sCzw.png"/></p><div class="article__tip">

shapes.</p><p class="text__p">Yandex services&#39; logos and icons: pieces of a unified ecosystem</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*6N5iJk8dicACqGMiI2zEdA.png"/></p><div class="article__tip">

A message in a well-defined system.</p><p class="text__p">So, as a visual designer, do you need drawing/sketching skills? This is how I would answer this question: you have to
feel shape and form to find effective means of expression for a given context and expand those to a broader set of
cases. I think I didn&#39;t learn how to sketch properly, but I can &quot;catch&quot; the shape I need — sometimes, after a dozen
cmd+Z keystrokes.</p><p class="text__p">If foundation of a product form was laid out by someone else, do not start thinking about rebuilding it all from
scratch, but rather try to understand the system and see if you can carry on with it. The same, I think, applies to
interior design: you don&#39;t have to create the items yourself, yet finding a balanced combination is essential, as well
as extending the existing combination whenever necessary.</p><p class="text__p">Google&#39;s brand action buttons:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*WMVseMDKhlEHbb9F5pjZMA.png"/></p><p class="text__p">The Like icon uses a recognizable shade of blue and familiar Facebook style</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*_MHgKOoHri0DsT663IIyfQ.png"/></p><p class="text__p">Yandex.Money logo: as sharp and yellow as the search form on its main page</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*Vw-E9-COuAwfBerQfj-N8A.png"/></p><p class="text__p">A Windows 8 logo is an introduction to the OS style</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*kb9PDJOfuOICxRHXU-hliw.png"/></p><p class="text__p">All visual features of iOS7, packed into one icon</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*G__j5kCIz1sNFYDtezQEFw.png"/></p><p class="text__p">Form expresses the mood of an interface, its own nature. Form is a &quot;coordinate system&quot; in which the means of expression
must evolve. It shapes the first product impression and leaves a distinctive footprint in memory, thus being a valued
characteristic of any product.</p><hr>
<p class="text__p">Color is a detachable part of the form. It emphasizes the unity of various elements on the screen, highlights key
points, creates a recognizable image. Color is usually extracted from a logo or a predominant visual.</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*e4AAtApZftYamtdKZA5S_Q.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*AAuzaO3dxe-qkywagiZYtA.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*XweyY0O9-JQrOKn5_3ZOFQ.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*hmoTNpTvM4Dbhks8Oq5EKQ.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*Jf2I2FwE4kQr1AwnzGNIMw.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*8va2qDAAJxq52MwTKoRzmQ.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*tJSowLjIcP-moI-uHAqM8Q.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*kGrDDiWH-tIYZxvt7OT6-g.png"/></p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*2e6A2ugcf8u_yBwgsO_QkQ.png"/></p><hr>
<p class="text__p">Font is also a form, and that means it can be unique and important asset of a product.</p><p class="text__p">VK.com chose the &quot;system&quot; Tahoma font that is seldom used on the Web, and those recognizable small letters got

The Textbook

The billboard advertises Yandex.Maps. They show their headquarter address (Lv. Tolstoy str, Moscow) as an example.
</div>

<p class="text__p">In other words, even non-designers associate a font with a brand. The shape of letters is equally important as the logo
shape or color; when a logo drops out of sight or brand identity color can&#39;t be used, we still have the font.</p><hr>
<p class="text__p">Why do I put so much emphasis on the product identity? All these properties — form, color or font — define frames and
guidelines one should follow to make the product stand out in the market. They help us avoid stylistical uncertainty
and focus on the content.</p><h2 class="text-header text-header_lvl_2" id="content"><a href="#content" class="text-header__anchor">Content</a></h2><p class="text__p">Any interface is also an element hierarchy. Using shape, size, color, alignment and context, we separate primary
elements from secondary ones, content that can be omitted from content that deserves user&#39;s attention.</p><p class="text__p">Text also has a hierarchical structure: headings, subheadings, paragraphs, nested lists. Inside any text, there are more important and less important things. Many actions applicable to an interface can also be applied to texts: we can improve it, make it comprehensible, more interesting, shorter, disambiguate it etc.</p><p class="text__p">Text is a special case of a data model, and a data model is used to build an interface around it. Let&#39;s make one step
back to see how the product visualization process happens. Here&#39;s a simple example: an interface for a new e-mail
message form. We start by formally defining the incoming data model:</p><pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": {} }'><code>Message
  From
    address
  To
    address1
    address2
    ...
  Copy
    address1
    address2
    ...
  Subject
  Date
  Content
    Text
    Images
    ...
  Actions
    Translation
    Options</code></pre><p class="text__p">The interface is built on top the data. There is one model with multiple possible representations. One of those is, in
our case, the new message form:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*P09dV9gJUKfeQ9thE6goEA.png"/></p><div class="article__tip">
Input fields at the top: To and Subject. Controls at the bottom: Options (selector), Attach, Translate, and Send.
</div>

<p class="text__p">&quot;From&quot; and &quot;Date&quot; fields were put aside, and &quot;CC&quot; was moved into Options. Using the same model, we can create a couple
of extra representations: the message itself, and its shortened version in the thread selection column.</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*u_8KVPOlyCduP8_0dU6zvg.png"/></p><p class="text__p">Thus, designer has to study the data model thoroughly before starting to create a representation (interface).</p><p class="text__p">The statement above may sounds unconvincing as the supporting example is quite primitive. Here is something else.
I&#39;ve already mentioned that I worked for a popular science web resource as a developer and, later, as a designer.
During that time, I had to read many articles on nutrition and diets, and collect the necessary data about
<a href="http://wyg.su/js/services/food.data.js?f4033cc">360</a> essential products, only to create this
<a href="http://whoyougle.ru/services/food">nutrition calculator</a>.</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*IkrVskq3GWOPSPmmb3z94g.png"/></p><div class="article__tip">

<p class="text__p">To design an <a href="http://whoyougle.ru/services/fitness">online fitness guide</a>, I had to read a small book on physical
excercise.</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*RtWcfP05m97a4YrDHA-pIQ.png"/></p><div class="article__tip">

<p class="text__p">The model of incoming data is often poorly or vaguely defined, and it&#39;s a designer&#39;s responsibility to formalize
and finalize it.</p><hr>
<p class="text__p">For a promo screen, input data is the marketing idea to highlight certain product features, or change the way customers
perceive the product. It would be a terrible mistake for a designer to create a so-called &quot;draft design&quot; which is
filled in with text later — most likely, by a third party. Designer and copyrighter have to work together, combining
words and graphics into a holistic experience, so that the result looks like this:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1019/1*bXjq7gmQVdNgU_YA0PYenA.png"/></p><p class="text__p">...and not like this:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/978/1*th_M1iFJVwnTrMIXP1UDpg.png"/></p><div class="article__tip">

claim they helped shape the initial idea from the very beginning. This is probably the reason why the systematic
approach (one that involves data structures, logical schemes, complicated prototypes) doesn&#39;t have that much
credibility or support.</p><p class="text__p">How many designers would be able to list all the types and states of the buttons they&#39;re using in the interface they
work with? Can they remember the sizing scale: what is the height of a small button, a medium one, a large one?</p><p class="text__p">I always liked to play with Lego pieces, trying to combine then in different ways. Sometimes it looked like its
creators themselves didn&#39;t know all the possible combinations but just followed a set of strict rules, and because of
that, those pieces of plastic are interlocking in many different combinations, allowing for infinite number of
complicated objects to be built from a finite set of simple elements.</p><p class="text__p">How did I connect this Lego principle with the interface domain?

This is how you get a search form:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*l2OigbMS457aC4ijEfIIVg.png"/></p><p class="text__p">A combobox:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*8QSp9NPXjlGuJbREGS-5_w.png"/></p><p class="text__p">A payment form:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*9oQ8KeDPIhaWMuBHWeohYA.png"/></p><p class="text__p">Sometimes we have to highlight a form element (e.g. to point out an input error). A contrast popup can be used for this:</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*aMpfoFUQPbbz1QH9Y-P38g.png"/></p><p class="text__p">A sizing scale has been defined before: 24, 28, and 32 px. All the controls (from a button to a slider) have this
height already, and it would be logical to have popups aligned along the same scale. Thus, popups in a form, even if
displayed next to each field, won&#39;t conflict with each other, and all the elements will align themselves horizontally
and vertically.</p><p class="text__p"><img class="text-image i-bem" data-bem='{ "text-image": {} }'  src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*OlJV9QaWwfiR4iFKQpA9jg.png"/></p><p class="text__p">Element paddings can also be defined within the same scale. I set those to be either 6, 10, 16 or 20 px, so that each
of them is divisible by two.</p><p class="text__p">On the one hand, this keeps yourself organized and helps a lot. On the other hand, as the system grows, means of
expression also grow, more elements and modifications are added, connections between elements become complicated, and
the model gets more difficult to maintain. These details are too subtle; graphic editor software won&#39;t take care of
that, so a lot has to be kept just in your head. Communicating the system to another person is hard as a lot of details
are hard to explain or simply get lost, and after some time, you the designer start forgetting about some of those
details, too.</p><p class="text__p">I&#39;ll explain once more why it is so complicated. Imagine a search interface that has to give an answer to any query or
question. That answer comes not as simple hyperlinks or text, but as objects, video, music player, images, maps,
phone numbers and addresses, goods with price tags and &quot;buy now&quot; buttons, ads, forms, calculators and converters,
graphs and counters. Now imagine that every answer is interactive: you can touch it and it expands, or shows a new
block on the side. This is only the main search interface. There are also specialized search interfaces for video,
images, music, maps, goods, people, news, dictionaries, cars and so on — all these have to work in a way similar to
the main search, but also add some unique features and experience. There are also standalone services which have to
look and feel like the main search, but... at this point you&#39;ve got my idea, right?</p><p class="text__p">An instrument is needed that would allow for controlling the system without exponentially increasing the price of
adding new components. However, Titanic (for example) was perfectly controllable — without much success. Actually,
I prefer the term &quot;juggling&quot; instead of &quot;controlling&quot;.</p><p class="text__p">I see my colleagues constantly looking for a silver bullet in a graphical interface. In inDesign, one finds text style
classes; Axure allows a prototype to be built from a series of screens; Sketch supports object libraries and builds
screens from object copies. Each tool reaches its limits sooner or later: an editor won&#39;t support behavior definitions,
and a prototyping environment won&#39;t have support for an object library or any other dynamic actions except for
switching between the screens.</p><p class="text__p">Instead of those limits, I see endless possibilities as vast as the outer space. The closer to the stars I fly,
the bigger the universe seems to be. The first insight happens when you learn HTML. Working with lists, huge texts
and tables finally becomes comfortable: there are many settings to play with to achieve the ideal balance, test
various representations with different data and minimal effort.</p><p class="text__p">During interviewing and hiring process, we at Yandex sometimes ask people to send us a prototype of a beautiful table
representing data on 170 employees or a couple of documentation pages with paragraphs and subsections, code examples,
lists, method tables and other formatting. Some candidates manually arrange 170 portraits in Photoshop, to make it
look outstanding, other ones write a script to fill the same layout with different data on 170 people from their
Facebook friend list. These two kinds of candidates are equally interesting for us.</p><hr>
<p class="text__p">Are you sure your project won&#39;t grow to that level of complexity? Should you avoid this complexity at all, or is it a
just a level-up? How could you be possibly sure that your project won&#39;t get two dozen extra screens in a couple of
months? If you work with a flow of similar clients (corporate clients, for example), do you ever consider factoring out
common interface elements? Did you ever trust a different designer on your team with creating some follow-up screens
for your own project?</p><p class="text__p">I won&#39;t be showcasing examples of code that save hours and hours of manual work, as sharing another link to CSS and
JavaScript resources these days is redundant, to say the least. What I&#39;m trying to emphasize is that this might be
the new perspective, the new way to expand your knowledge and expertise. Learn development tools not to prove that
you are smarter then other, not to aquire another skill, not to understand programmers&#39; humor better, but only to hit
the limit and break out of it, into the outer space of possibilities.</p><h2 class="text-header text-header_lvl_2" id="critics"><a href="#critics" class="text-header__anchor">Critics</a></h2><p class="text__p">How would you recognize a good design? I already mentioned some of the key factors: clear and emotionally defined form,
visual language, systematic approach. Each of the factors has to follow the product&#39;s goal. A good design features
unified, carefully chosen and well-integrated forms where key points are highlighted by means of words or shapes.
As a result, the message should be clear and comprehensible.</p><hr>

            <title><![CDATA[What Every Frontend Developer Should Know About Webpage Rendering]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="text__p">Today I&#39;d like to focus on the subject of web page rendering and why it is important in web development. A lot of articles are available covering the subject, but the information is scattered and somehow fragmented. To wrap my head around the subject, for example, I had to study a lot of sources. That&#39;s why I decided I should write this article. I believe the article will be useful for beginners as well as for more advanced developers who want to refresh and structure what they already know.</p><!-- cut -->

<p class="text__p">Rendering has to be optimized from the very beginning, when the page layout is being defined, as styles and scripts play the crucial role in page rendering. Professionals have to know certain tricks to avoid performance problems.</p><p class="text__p">This arcticle does not study the inner browser mechanics in detail, but rather offers some common principles. Different browser engines work differently, this would make a browser-specific study even more complicated.</p><h2 class="text-header text-header_lvl_2" id="how-do-browsers-render-a-web-page"><a href="#how-do-browsers-render-a-web-page" class="text-header__anchor">How do browsers render a web page</a></h2><p class="text__p">We start with an overview of browser actions when rendering a page:</p><ol>
<li>The DOM (Document Object Model) is formed from the HTML that is received from a server.</li>
<li>Styles are loaded and parsed, forming the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).</li>
<li>On top of DOM and CSSOM, a rendering tree is created, which is a set of objects to be rendered (Webkit calls each of those a &quot;renderer&quot; or &quot;render object&quot;, while in Gecko it&#39;s a &quot;frame&quot;). Render tree reflects the DOM structure except for invisible elements (like the &lt;head&gt; tag or elements that have <code>display:none;</code> set). Each text string is represented in the rendering tree as a separate renderer. Each of the rendering objects contains its corresponding DOM object (or a text block) plus the calculated styles. In other words, the render tree describes the visual representation of a DOM.</li>
<li>For each render tree element, its coordinates are calculated, which is called &quot;layout&quot;. Browsers use a flow method which only required one pass to layout all the elements (tables require more than one pass).</li>
<li>Finally, this gets actually displayed in a browser window, a process called &quot;painting&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text__p">When users interact with a page, or scripts modify it, some of the aforementioned operations have to be repeated, as the underlying page structure changes.</p><h3 class="text-header text-header_lvl_3" id="repaint"><a href="#repaint" class="text-header__anchor">Repaint</a></h3><p class="text__p">When changing element styles which don&#39;t affect the element&#39;s position on a page (such as <code>background-color</code>, <code>border-color</code>, <code>visibility</code>), the browser just repaints the element again with the new styles applied (that means a &quot;repaint&quot; or &quot;restyle&quot; is happening).</p><h3 class="text-header text-header_lvl_3" id="reflow"><a href="#reflow" class="text-header__anchor">Reflow</a></h3><p class="text__p">When the changes affect document contents or structure, or element position, a reflow (or relayout) happens. These changes are usually triggered by:</p><ul>
<li>DOM manipulation (element addition, deletion, altering, or changing element order);</li>
<li>Contents changes, including text changes in form fields;</li>
<li>Calculation or altering of CSS properties;</li>
<li>Adding or removing style sheets;</li>
<li>Changing the &quot;class&quot; attribute;</li>
<li>Browser window manipulation (resizing, scrolling);</li>
<li>Pseudo-class activation (:hover).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-header text-header_lvl_2" id="how-browsers-optimize-rendering"><a href="#how-browsers-optimize-rendering" class="text-header__anchor">How browsers optimize rendering</a></h2><p class="text__p">Browsers are doing their best to restrict repaint/reflow to the area that covers the changed elements only. For eaxmple, a size change in an absolute/fixed positioned element only affects the element itself and its descendants, whereas a similar change in a statically positioned element triggers reflow for all the subsequent elements.</p><p class="text__p">Other optimization technique is that while running pieces of JavaScript code, browsers cache the changes, and appl them in a single pass after the code was run. For example, this piece of code will only trigger one reflow and repaint:</p><pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": { "lang": "js"} }'><code>var $body = $('body');
$body.css('padding', '1px'); // reflow, repaint
$body.css('color', 'red'); // repaint
$body.css('margin', '2px'); // reflow, repaint
// only 1 reflow and repaint will actually happen</code></pre><p class="text__p">However, as mentioned above, accessing an element property triggers a forced reflow. This will happen if we add an extra line that reads an element property to the previous block:</p><pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": { "lang": "js"} }'><code>var $body = $('body');
$body.css('padding', '1px');
$body.css('padding'); // reading a property, a forced reflow
$body.css('color', 'red');
$body.css('margin', '2px');</code></pre><p class="text__p">As a result, we get 2 reflows instead of one. Because of this, you should group reading element properties together to optimize performance (<a href="http://jsbin.com/duhah/2/edit">see a more detailed example on JSBin</a>).</p><p class="text__p">There are situations when you have to trigger a forced reflow. Example: we have to apply the same property (&quot;margin-left&quot; for example) to the same element twice. Initially, it should be set to <code>100px</code> without animation, and then it has to be animated with <code>transition</code> to a value of <code>50px</code>. You can study this example <a href="http://jsbin.com/qutev/1/edit">on JSBin</a> right now, but I&#39;ll describe it here in more detail.</p><p class="text__p">We start by creating a CSS class with a transition:</p><pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": { "lang": "css"} }'><code>.has-transition {
   -webkit-transition: margin-left 1s ease-out;
      -moz-transition: margin-left 1s ease-out;
        -o-transition: margin-left 1s ease-out;
           transition: margin-left 1s ease-out;
}</code></pre><p class="text__p">Then proceed with the implementation:</p><pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": { "lang": "js"} }'><code>// our element that has a "has-transition" class by default
var $targetElem = $('#targetElemId');

// remove the transition class
$targetElem.removeClass('has-transition');

// change the property expecting the transition to be off, as the class is not there
// anymore
$targetElem.css('margin-left', 100);

// put the transition class back
$targetElem.addClass('has-transition');

// change the property
$targetElem.css('margin-left', 50);</code></pre><p class="text__p">This implementation, however, does not work as expected. The changes are cached and applied only at the end of the code block. What we need is a forced reflow, which we can achieve by making the following changes:</p><pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": { "lang": "js"} }'><code>// remove the transition class
$(this).removeClass('has-transition');

// change the property
$(this).css('margin-left', 100);

// trigger a forced reflow, so that changes in a class/property get applied immediately
$(this)[0].offsetHeight; // an example, other properties would work, too

// put the transition class back
$(this).addClass('has-transition');

// change the property
$(this).css('margin-left', 50);</code></pre><p class="text__p">Now this works as expected.</p><h2 class="text-header text-header_lvl_2" id="practical-advice-on-opmitization"><a href="#practical-advice-on-opmitization" class="text-header__anchor">Practical advice on opmitization</a></h2><p class="text__p">Summarizing the available information, I could recommend the following:</p><ul>
<li>Create valid HTML and CSS, do not forget to specify the document encoding. Styles should be included into &lt;head&gt;, and scripts appended to the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag.</li>
<li>Try to simplify and optimize CSS selectors (this optimization is almost universally ignored by developers who mostly use CSS preprocessors). Keep nesting levels at a minimum. This is how CSS selectors rank according to their performance (starting from the fastest ones):<ol>
<li>Identificator: <code>#id</code></li>
<li>Class: <code>.class</code></li>
<li>Tag: <code>div</code></li>
<li>Adjacent sibling selector: <code>a + i</code></li>
<li>Parent selector: <code>ul &gt; li</code></li>
<li>Universal selector: <code>*</code></li>
<li>Attribute selector: <code>input[type=&quot;text&quot;]</code></li>
<li>Pseudoclasses and pseudoelements: <code>a:hover</code>
You should remember that browsers process selectors from right to left, that&#39;s why the rightmost selector should be the fastest one — either <code>#id</code> or <code>.class</code>:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="highlight i-bem" data-bem='{ "highlight": { "lang": "css"} }'><code>div * {...} // bad
.list li {...} // bad
.list-item {...} // good
#list .list-item {...} // good</code></pre><ol>
<li>In your scripts, minimize DOM manipulation whenever possible. Cache everything, including properties and objects (if they are to be reused). It&#39;s better to work with an &quot;offline&quot; element when performing complicated manipulations (an &quot;offline&quot; element is one that is disconnected from DOM and only stored in memory), and append it to DOM afterwards.</li>
<li>If you use jQuery to select elements, follow <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/">jQuery selectors best practices</a>.</li>
<li>To change element&#39;s styles, modifying the &quot;class&quot; attribute is one of the most performant ways. The deeper in the DOM tree you perform this change, the better (also because this helps decouple logics from presentation).</li>
<li>Animate only absolute/fixed positioned elements if you can.</li>
<li>It is a good idea to disable complicated <code>:hover</code> animations while scrolling (e.g. by adding an extra &quot;no-hover&quot; class to &lt;body&gt;). <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/204238/">Read an article on the subject</a>.</li>
